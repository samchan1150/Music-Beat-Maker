# Music Beat Maker Application Overview

The Music Beat Maker is an interactive web application that empowers you to create and customize your own musical beats effortlessly. It's designed to be user-friendly, allowing both beginners and experienced musicians to compose rhythms using a variety of virtual instruments.

## How the App Works

### Instruments Panel
- On the left side of the app, you'll find a list of instruments. These include traditional percussion sounds like kick drum, snare, hi-hat, clap, tom, cowbell, ride cymbal, and shaker, as well as melodic instruments like bass and synth. Each instrument represents a distinct sound that you can incorporate into your beat.

### Sequencer Grid
- To the right of the instruments is the sequencer grid. This grid is the heart of the app, where you design your beat. The grid consists of rows and columns:
  - **Rows**: Each row corresponds to one of the instruments from the panel.
  - **Columns**: Each column represents a step in time within the beat sequence.

### Creating Beats
- **Activating Steps**: Click on the squares (cells) in the grid to activate or deactivate them. An activated cell indicates that the corresponding instrument will play at that specific point in the sequence.
- **Visual Feedback**: When a cell is activated, it changes color, providing a visual indication of active beats.

### Playback Controls
- **Play Button**: Starts the playback of your composed beat. As the beat plays, the app highlights the current column in the grid, so you can visually follow along with the sequence.
- **Stop Button**: Stops the playback at any time.

### Tempo Adjustment
- **Tempo Slider**: Adjust the speed of your beat using the tempo slider. Slide it to the left for a slower tempo or to the right for a faster one.
- **BPM Display**: The current tempo, measured in Beats Per Minute (BPM), is displayed next to the slider, updating in real-time as you adjust it.

### Step Control
- **Steps Input**: Define the length of your beat sequence by setting the number of steps (beats). You can choose any number between 4 and 32.
- **Update Steps Button**: After changing the number of steps, click this button to update the grid accordingly. The grid will resize to reflect the new sequence length.

## Interactive Experience

### Real-Time Composition
- The app allows you to hear the effects of your changes immediately. As you add or remove beats and adjust settings, you can play the sequence to hear how it sounds.

### Visual Sequencing
- The highlighted column during playback acts as a visual metronome, enhancing your ability to time your beats and understand the rhythm structure.

### Multiple Instruments
